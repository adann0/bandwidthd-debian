  [ Paul Gevers ]
  * Improve use of dbconfig-common for bandwidthd-pgsql (Closes: #789445)
    - it never created a working configuration file
    - it didn't ask for cleanup
    - it didn't recommend postgresl server
    - the answers from dbconfig-common were used before the questions
      were asked, yielding old answers upon upgrade, and non-functional
      defaults when installing
    - Typo in prerm script prevented proper clean-up on removal
  * Add patch to change short <? notation to <?php
  * Add patch to replace deprecated $HTTP_GET_VARS by $_GET

  [ Andreas Henriksson ]
  * Demote newly added postgres recommends to suggests
    - The main purpose of bandwidthd-pgsql is to allow multiple

      central (likely remote) database.

bandwidthd (1.2.1b-10) unstable; urgency=low

  Thanks to Petr Stehlik <pstehlik@sophics.cz> for testing the package
  on woody and suggesting an easy way to fix the file hierarchy problem.

  * Included reworked patches (which has been sent to upstream).
  * Included postinst, prerm, postrm scripts stolen from pdns.
  * Fixed up 2 minor issues in init.d-script for woody compability.
  
  This release puts the log*.cdf in /var/lib/bandwidthd/ and the html files
  in /var/lib/bandwidthd/htdocs/ instead of working out of /etc/bandwidthd/.
  The config files stays /etc/bandwidthd/bandwidthd.conf (obviously) though.
  The current solution still requires chdir, but that will hopefully soon be
  dealt with.

bandwidthd (1.2.1b-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed debian/rules to run dist-clean to avoid useless changes in diff.
  * Changed signal handling to be able to get the parent to signal the
    all the children. Sending SIGUSR1 to pid in /var/run/bandwidthd.pid now
    terminates all processes. Likewise SIGUSR2 does logrotate.
    (Logs aren't rotated for any other process then the main one, so SIGUSR2
    is pretty useless. The signal is propagated so when logrotate is enabled
    for all processes it will work.)
